  * Missing functions:
    + stdio:
      - fscanf
      - fgetws, fgetwc, ungetwc
      - pipe
    + zlib functions (eg. libpng)
    + divert crc checks or recompute checksums (yeah)

  * Detect crashes in the program's stdout/stderr (eg. mplayer) instead of
    just checking the return value

  * Marker support (eg. \r\n\r\n in HTTP responses)

  * ASCII support (more or less done), UTF-8 support

  * Finish the Win32 port:
    + pipe inheritance
    + signal handling
    + exported functions
    + memory limits

  * /etc/zzufrc and ~/.zzufrc files
    + global settings, overridden by the command line
    + ship rules such as -E '^/usr/' by default
