 About zzuf:

zzuf is a transparent application input fuzzer. It works by intercepting
file operations and changing random bits in the program's input. zzuf's
behaviour is deterministic, making it easy to reproduce bugs.

For instructions and examples on how to use zzuf, see the manual page
and the website at <http://caca.zoy.org/wiki/zzuf>.
